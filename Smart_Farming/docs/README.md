# Smart Farming Platform
# Problem Statement 

Unpredictable weather, poor soil health, pest attacks and fluctuating market prices are just a few of the difficulties faced by farmers. They frequently lack simple access to resources that might enable them to fully understand the data and make better choices.Small and rural farmers find it challenging to use the majority of current farming systems because they are too complicated not available in local languages or require continuous internet access. Farmers find it difficult to obtain up-to-date information about their crops which results in decreased yields and lost revenue.A straightforward, intelligent agricultural platform that makes use of AI and real time data is required to assist farmers in tracking crop health, forecasting yields, and keeping up with market and weather trends. 

# Goal 

The main goals of the **Smart Farming Platform** are to:

1. Monitor crop health using satellite images and AI.
2. Predict crop yield to help farmers to plan better.
3. Provide real time weather and soil information for informed decisions.
4. Show market trends and prices to improve farm profitability.
5. Create an easy to use multilingual web app for all farmers.
6. Enable offline access and alerts for the areas where there is less internet connectivity.
7. Support sustainable farming by reducing waste and optimizing resources available.
