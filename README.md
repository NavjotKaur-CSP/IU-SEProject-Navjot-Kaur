# Smart Farming Platform
# Abstract
Agriculture is the main source of income for millions of people and plays an important role in the economy. Farmers face many problems such as unpredictable weather, poor soil quality, pest attacks and change in the market prices. These problems become more serious when farmers do not have access to the accurate and timely information especially in rural or small-scale farming. The Smart Farming Platform is a web-based application developed to help farmers make better farming decisions using data and technology. the platform combines real-time data, satellite images and AI to provide useful insights. It allows farmers to monitor crop health, predict crop yield, view weather and soil conditions and receive alerst when risks are detected. These features help farmers plan their farming activities more effectively. The system is built using a layered architecture to keep the design simple and organized. The frontend provides a user friendly interface for farmers while the backend processess data and manages system logic using FastAPI. PostgreSQL is used to store farming and user data safety. Machine learning tools are used to analyze data and generate predictions. External data sources such as Weather API. satellite data and agricultural datasets are integrated into the platform. Overall, the Smart Farming Platform shows how technology and data can support farmers, improve productivity and promote sustainable farming practices.

# Goal

The main goals of the **Smart Farming Platform** are to:

1. Monitor crop health using satellite images and AI.
2. Predict crop yield to help farmers to plan better.
3. Provide real time weather and soil information for informed decisions.
4. Show market trends and prices to improve farm profitability.
5. Create an easy to use multilingual web app for all farmers.
6. Enable offline access and alerts for the areas where there is less internet connectivity.
7. Support sustainable farming by reducing waste and optimizing resources available.

# Project Risks
1. **Technical Risks -** Integrating multiple external APIs may increase system complexity and affect performance.
2. **Connectivity Risks -** Limited or unstable internet connectivity in rural areas may affect real-time data access and platform usability.
3. **Scalability Risks -** Handling increased user load and large datasets may require further optimization and infrastructure upgrades.
4. **Data Accuracy Risks -** Incompleted or outdated weather, soil or satellite data may reduce the accuracy of crop health analysis and yield predictions.
5. **Adoptation Risks -** Farmers may be hesitant to adopt new digital technologies due to the lack of technical knowledge or trust in AI-based systems.
